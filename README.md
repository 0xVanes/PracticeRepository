# Practice Projects
 This is a place where I showed what I practice in my class in Zero to mastery.
 So far there are two files that I included in this repository
 ## HTML NOTES (for my HTML)
 A small note for me to remember the functions of my html
 ## TreasureHunt (for python)
 A coding game for treasure hunt
 ## Detective Game (for python)
 A coding game for finding what happened to Mr. White
 ## Snake Game (for python)
 Made by using prompt engineering.
 The word that I ask from Chatgpt-4o was: "I want to create a snake game using python. what steps would I need to do that?"
 	At first the game doesn't work and it directly gave me the code, eventhough I only ask for the steps.
 So the next one that I wrote was: "It does not work on replit"
 	So it imported numpy and easygui. And the snake game worked, only left and right.
 The third command was:"the snake can only move left and right. can you modify the code?"
 	So it changed the line: y1_change += y1_change instead of updating y1 with y1_change. AND deleted the numpy and easygui once more! SO the game worked 100%
 ## Tic-Tac-Toe Game (for python)
 Another game made using chat-gpt. So at first it could give me a good output but the second time putting the output, the rows increases to 6. But now it is already in full functioning game
